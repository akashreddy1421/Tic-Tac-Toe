# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic Tac Toe, also known as Noughts and Crosses, is a simple, classic two-player game. Players take turns marking Xs and Os on a 3x3 grid. The objective is to be the first to align three of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game often ends in a draw if neither player achieves this.
